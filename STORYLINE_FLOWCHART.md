---

## Kerman's Path (Trust Him)

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| RFID Encryption Device | The Lab |
| Laboratory Master Pass | TerraGroup Lab offices (Kruglov's office) |
| Blank RFID Card | TBD |
| Encryptor Chip | TBD |

### Hideout Requirements

- **Solar Power Module** - Powers the encryption setup
- **Intelligence Center** - Must be operational

### Activate the Ticket

1. Use Intelligence Center to encrypt/activate the Ticket keycard
2. Kerman communicates final instructions

### Complete Side Quests (Required for Savior)

See [Side Quests section](#side-quests-required-for-savior) below.

### Terminal Battle

- **Location:** Terminal
- **Enemy:** Black Division
- **Outcome depends on:**
  - Survival
  - Side quest completion status

| Result | Ending |
|--------|--------|
| Survive + ALL side quests complete | 🌟 **Savior** |
| Survive + side quests incomplete | 💀 **Fallen** |
| Die | 💀 **Fallen** |

---

## Go Your Own Way (Refuse Kerman)

> If you refused to trust Mr. Kerman

### Steps

1. **Head to Terminal**

---

## Decision 3: Prapor's Bribe

> **Final decision** (only if you refused Kerman)

### Option A: Pay ₽500M (or ₽300M)

- **Cost:** ₽300,000,000 - ₽500,000,000
- **Outcome:** 🛡️ **Survivor Ending**
- **Description:** You escape by bribing the gatekeepers. Pragmatic outcome - you survive but don't address the broader Tarkov conflict.

### Option B: Refuse to Pay

- **Cost:** None (you can't afford it or won't pay)
- **Outcome:** ⛓️ **Debtor Ending**
- **Description:** Bleakest result. "Escape from Tarkov without ever escaping from yourself." Your debts and mistakes catch up to you.

> **Note:** This option was initially disabled in-game to prevent players from trivially rushing the worst ending.
