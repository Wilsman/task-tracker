# TODO

## Bugs to squash

- [ ] Network Provider 1 auto-marks all prereqs when unlocked via storyline; prevent prereq auto-complete for that path
- [ ] Missing quest: "No Questions Asked" (unlocked after Punisher 6, not Kappa) — add temporary override until API updates
- [ ] Test Drive parts 4/5 show level 40 with PMC level filter; correct to 28/32

## UX/Logic improvements

- [ ] Mutually exclusive quests: completing one should auto-complete the other(s) to avoid re-selection
- [ ] Add 3-state quest status (complete / in progress / not started) with sort & filter for in-progress tasks
- [x] Make trader/map toggle in CheckListView more visible/clear

## Planned features

- [x] Bulk mark prestige quests complete (done)
- [ ] Found-in-Raid item tracker for quests + hideout
- [ ] Kappa speedrun quest order guide
- [ ] Surface small notices for new features or warnings
